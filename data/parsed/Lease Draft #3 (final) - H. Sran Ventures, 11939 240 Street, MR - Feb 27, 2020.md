- (a) the Tenant shall pay on the first day of every month the Basic Rent and Additional Rent for the balance of the intended Term of this Lease as if re-entry had not been made, less the actual amount received by the Landlord after re-entry from any subsequent leasing for the balance of the intended Term; and
- (b) the Landlord will be entitled to re-let the Premises and the Tenant will be responsible to the Landlord for all damages suffered by the Landlord as a result of the Tenant's breach or default.

Re-entry will not operate as a waiver or satisfaction in whole or in part of any right, claim or demand of the Landlord in connection with any breach or failure by the Tenant in respect of any of its obligations under this Lease.

# 14.04  Distress.

- (a) All the goods and personal property of the Tenant in the Premises or wherever located will be liable to distress and sale for arrears of Rent without exemption, including the Basic Rent, Additional Rent and accelerated Rent and none of the goods or personal property in the Premises will be exempt from distress, seizure and sale for arrears of Rent and the Tenant waives the benefit of all present or future statutes limiting or eliminating the Landlord's right of distress.
- (b) The Landlord may use all force it deems necessary to gain admission to the Premises without being liable to any action or for any resulting loss or damage and the Tenant hereby releases the Landlord from all actions, proceedings, claims and demands in respect of such distress. If the Tenant removes any goods or personal property from the Premises, the Landlord may follow them for ninety (90) days after removal.
- (c) The exercise of the Landlord's right of distress will not prejudice or adversely affect the Landlord's right to pursue any other remedies for recovery of Rent as the Landlord deems necessary. The Landlord may distrain, notwithstanding that it has sued for Rent or re-entered under section 14.01 or 14.02, and the Landlord may concurrently pursue distress and all other remedies to it under this Lease.

# 14.06  Payments After Termination

No payment of money by the Tenant to the Landlord after the expiration of the Term or other termination of this Lease or after the giving of any notice by the Landlord to the Tenant, will reinstate, continue, renew or extend the Term or make ineffective any notice given to the Tenant prior to the payment of such money. After the service of notice or the commencement of a suit, or after final judgment granting the Landlord possession of the Premises, the Landlord may receive and collect any sums of Rent due under this Lease, and the payment thereof will not make ineffective any notice, or in any manner affect any pending suit or any judgment theretofore obtained.

In the event that any party hereto shall be delayed or hindered in or prevented from the performance of any act required hereunder by reason of acts of God, strikes, lock-outs, labour troubles, riots, insurrection, war or other reason of a nature beyond such party’s control in performing work or doing acts required under the terms of this Lease, then performance of such act shall be excused for the period of the delay and the party delayed shall do what was delayed or prevented as soon as reasonably possible after the delay and shall use all reasonable efforts to minimize the effects of the event of Force Majeure. Financial inability of the Landlord or Tenant or any other party shall not be considered to be an event of Force Majeure. Any party so delayed shall give prompt written notice to the other parties if it becomes subject to an event of Force Majeure and shall advise as to the anticipated duration of such event.

# 15.02  No Representations by Landlord.

There are no promises, representations or undertakings by or binding on the Landlord with respect to any alteration, remodelling or decorating, or installation of equipment or fixtures in the Premises or with respect to any other matter, except as expressly set out in this Lease and Offer to Lease.

Time is of the essence of this Lease.

# 15.06  Waiver.

The failure of the Landlord to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation of the Tenant in this Lease or to exercise any right or option hereunder will not be a waiver or relinquishment of that covenant or obligation or any other default hereunder. The acceptance of any Rent from or the performance of any obligation hereunder by anyone other than the Tenant will not be an admission by the Landlord of any right, title or interest of such person as a sub-tenant, assignee, transferee or otherwise in the place of the Tenant, nor shall it constitute a waiver of any breach of this Lease. If the Landlord makes an error in calculating or billing any monies payable by the Tenant under this Lease, such will not be a waiver of the Landlord's right to collect the proper amount of monies payable by the Tenant.

# 15.07  Interest.

The Tenant shall pay to the Landlord interest at a rate equal to the commercial prime lending rate of the Landlord's bank plus five per cent per annum calculated, compounded and payable monthly on all money payable by the Tenant pursuant to this Lease, which has become overdue, as long as such payments remain unpaid by the Tenant, which interest will be recoverable as Additional Rent.

This Lease constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Premises except as contained in the Offer to Lease and where there is any inconsistency between this Lease and the Offer to Lease, the terms of this Lease shall govern.

# 15.09  No Changes or Waivers.

No changes to or waiver of any part of this Lease will be binding or enforceable unless reduced to writing and executed by the Landlord and the Tenant and if so executed shall be binding upon the Indemnifier, if any.

# SCHEDULE B

# (Miscellaneous Provisions)

# 1.00 Renewal Option(s)

(a) If the Tenant punctually, duly and regularly pays the Rent and observes and performs all its obligations in this Lease, the Landlord shall grant the Tenant two (2) renewal options of this Lease for terms of five (5) years each on the same terms as this Lease, except for the Basic Rent which will be determined as set out in this section, and except for any free rent, tenant inducements or tenant's improvements provided by the Landlord to the Tenant, which will be deleted.

(b) Each option can only be exercised by the Tenant giving written notice of exercise to the Landlord, not more than three hundred sixty-five (365) days nor less than one hundred eighty (180) days before the end of the Initial Term or last renewal which formed part of the Term, as the case may be.

(c) After an option has been exercised, the Landlord and Tenant shall promptly attempt to agree on the Basic Rent for the renewal term, which will be the Fair Market Basic Rent as defined in this section, but in any event not less than the equivalent Basic Rent paid during the last year of the Initial Term or last renewal which formed part of the Term, as the case may be. If the parties are not able to agree on the Basic Rent by sixty (60) days before the beginning of the renewal term, such Basic Rent will be determined by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Act of British Columbia. The domestic rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (the "Centre") or any successor institution, if any, if the Centre ceases to carry on business will be applicable to such arbitration (with the exception of rules requiring the Centre to administer the arbitration and with respect to the payment of fees to the Centre for such administration). The arbitrator will be a member of the Appraisal Institute of Canada or its successor, and the cost of the arbitration will be borne as ordered by the arbitrator.

(d) "Fair Market Basic Rent" means the Basic Rent generally prevailing sixty (60) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or last renewal which formed part of the Term, as the case may be, for leases of similar size premises of the same class of space in the area in which the Premises are located or comparable areas, which leases have been recently negotiated. In determining such Basic Rent, the value of all leasehold improvements installed on the Premises by the Tenant and the Landlord will be included.

(e) If such Basic Rent has not been determined by the beginning of the renewal term, the Tenant shall until such determination pay the Basic Rent payable during the last year of the Initial Term or last renewal which formed part of the Term, as the case may be. Any additional Basic Rent owing for the renewal term before such determination will be payable by the Tenant within ten (10) days after such determination. Interest as set out in section 15.07 will be payable by the Tenant to the Landlord on such additional Basic Rent, calculated from the date of commencement of the renewal term to the date such additional amounts are paid.

If the Tenant fails to forthwith pay the amount so demanded by the Landlord, the Landlord will have the same rights and remedies as are available to it for unpaid Rent.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the terms of section 8 of this Agreement, any notice which the Landlord desires to give to the Indemnifier shall be sufficiently given if delivered to the Indemnifier in accordance with the provisions for the giving of notice set out in the Lease and every such notice is deemed to have been given if given in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. The Indemnifier may designate by written notice a substitute address for that set forth above or in the Lease and thereafter notices if applicable shall be directed to such substitute address. If two or more Persons are named as Indemnifier, any notice given hereunder or under the Lease shall be sufficiently given if delivered or mailed in the foregoing manner to any one of such Persons.

# 4.

In the event of a default under the Lease or under this Agreement, the Indemnifier waives any right to require the Landlord to:

- (a) proceed against the Tenant or pursue any rights or remedies against the Tenant with respect to the Lease;
- (b) proceed against or exhaust any security of the Tenant held by the Landlord; or

(c) pursue any other remedy whatsoever in the Landlord’s power.

The Landlord has the right to enforce this Indemnity regardless of the acceptance of additional security from the Tenant and regardless of any release or discharge of the Tenant by the Landlord or by others or by operation of any law.

# 5.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the liability of the Indemnifier under this Indemnity is not and is not deemed to have been waived, released, discharged, impaired or affected by reason of the release or discharge of the Tenant in any receivership, bankruptcy, winding-up or other creditors proceedings or the rejection, disaffirmance or disclaimer of the Lease in any proceeding and shall continue with respect to the periods prior thereto and thereafter, for and with respect to the Term as if the Lease had not been disaffirmed or disclaimed, and in furtherance hereof, the Indemnifier agrees, upon any such disaffirmance or disclaimer, that the Indemnifier shall, at the option of the Landlord, become the Tenant of the Landlord upon the same terms and conditions as are contained in the Lease, applied mutatis mutandis. The liability of the Indemnifier shall not be affected by any repossession of the Premises by the Landlord, provided, however, that the net payments received by the Landlord after deducting all costs and expenses of repossessing and reletting the Premises shall be credited from time to time by the Landlord against the indebtedness of the Indemnifier hereunder and the Indemnifier shall pay any balance owing to the Landlord from time to time immediately upon demand.

# 6.

No action or proceedings brought or instituted under this Indemnity and no recovery in pursuance thereof shall be a bar or defence to any further action or proceeding which may be brought under this Indemnity by reason of any further default hereunder or in the performance and observance of the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Lease.

# 7.

No modification of this Indemnity shall be effective unless the same is in writing and is executed by both the Indemnifier and the Landlord.

# 8.

The Indemnifier shall, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, be bound by this Indemnity in the same manner as though the Indemnifier were the Tenant named in the Lease and for greater certainty, any matter approved or agreed upon from time to time by the Tenant will be considered to have been approved and agreed upon by the Indemnifier, and for this purpose the Landlord may treat the Tenant as the representative of the Indemnifier. The Landlord will be free to deal with the Tenant without seeking the approval or consent of or notifying or advising the Indemnifier and, in connection with this Lease and all related matters, any notice or communication made or given by the Landlord to the Tenant will be deemed to be effectively made or given to the Indemnifier. As between the Landlord and the Indemnifier, the Indemnifier accepts the entire responsibility for ensuring that it will be kept apprised (by the Tenant) of all matters concerning this Lease and for ensuring that the Tenant seeks and obtains approval or concurrence of the Indemnifier (to the extent that the Indemnifier may be affected, or would like to be consulted) for matters concerning this Lease including any such renewal, modification, amendment, or extension thereof.
